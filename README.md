For this project I used libraries such as <b>Dagger2</b>, <b>Retrofit</b> and <b>ButterKnife</b>. ViewGroups such as <b>ConstraintLayout</b> and <b>RecyclerView</b>. Also i applied MVP design pattern.


This application can:
<ul>
  <li>Download XML</li>
  <li>Parse XML</li>
  <li>Save it to the SQLite database</li>
  <li>Show it with RecyclerView</li>
  <li>Edit and save fields</li>
</ul>
